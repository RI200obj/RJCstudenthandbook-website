          RJC Student Handbook
          <p></p>In the beginning years of RJC, quotes put down by Mr Rudy Mosbergen, the founding principal of the school then, sprinkled across different parts of the student's book. ‚ÄúThe impossible we do at once, miracles take a little longer‚Äù was one of them. These quotes inspired many students when they were experiencing difficult times back then.<p></p></h1>
